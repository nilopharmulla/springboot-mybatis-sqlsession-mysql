Stomach cancer

Stomach/gastric cancer is characterized by a growth of cancerous cells within the lining of the stomach. Risk factors may include smoking, a diet of highly processed or salty foods and bacterial infections. Symptoms may include feeling bloated after eating, feeling full after eating small amounts of food, nausea, heartburn or indigestion.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Gastric cancer patients exhibit a 2- to 3-fold higher rate of a family history, suggesting that a family history of gastric cancer is an independent risk factor.
