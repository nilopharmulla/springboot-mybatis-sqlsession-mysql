Pancreatic cancer

Pancreatic cancer begins in the cells of the pancreas which is lying behind the lower part of the stomach. Risk factors include tobacco use, being overweight, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, inherited genetic syndromes, exposure to environmental toxins and cirrhosis. There are no symptoms in the early stages, later stages may include abdominal pain, loss of appetite or unintended weight loss, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Healthy individuals who come from a family with FPC (Familial pancreatic cancer) are likely to have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer in their lifetime.
