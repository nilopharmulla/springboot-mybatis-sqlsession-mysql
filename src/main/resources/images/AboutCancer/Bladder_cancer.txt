Bladder cancer

Bladder cancer is where the growth of abnormal tissue, known as a tumor, develops in the inner lining of the bladder. Smoking is single biggest risk factor of the bladder cancer. Common symptoms are blood in the urine, pain or burning sensation during urination, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations.  People who have family members with bladder cancer have a higher risk of getting it themselves.
