Colorectal cancer

Colorectal cancer is the development of cancer from the colon (large intestine) or rectum. Smoking, alcohol use, being overweight and personal history of colorectal polyps are some of the risk factors. Symptoms include changes in bowel habits, changes in stool consistency, blood in the stool and abdominal discomfort.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. A family history of colorectal cancer, colon polyps, bowel diseases and with the increasing age, chances of developing cancer also increase.
