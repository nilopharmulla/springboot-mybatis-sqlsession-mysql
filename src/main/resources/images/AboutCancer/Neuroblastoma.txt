Neuroblastoma

Neuroblastoma is a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells, most often found in an embryo or foetus. It usually affects kids under 5 years. Symptoms may include fatigue, loss of appetite and fever. There may be a lump or compression of tissues in the affected area.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Children with a family history of neuroblastoma may be more likely to develop the disease.
