Cervical cancer

Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, that connects to the vagina. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major risk factor for cervical cancer. Symptoms include bleeding in between periods and after sexual intercourse.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Cervical cancer may run in some families. If any of the female had cervical cancer in the past, chances of developing the disease are higher than if no one in the family had it.
