Breast cancer

Breast cancer occurs when some breast cells rapidly grow abnormally and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Breast cancer affects women and rarely affects men. Breast cancer is mainly associated with the faulty genes, advancing age, being overweight to obese after menopause, etc. Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, bloody discharge from the nipple and changes in the shape or texture of the nipple or breast.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary, meaning that they result directly from gene changes (mutations) passed on from a parent.
