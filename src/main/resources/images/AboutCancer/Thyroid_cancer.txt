Thyroid cancer

Thyroid cancer is a solid tumor cancer that usually shows up as a nodule, or mass, in the thyroid gland. This gland produces hormones that regulate your metabolism, help control body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. But as it grows, it can cause pain and swelling in your neck
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. A family history of thyroid cancer, goitre or thyroid disease are at a greater risk of developing thyroid cancer.
