Meningioma

Meningioma is a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor that arises from the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The cause of meningioma is not known. Exposure to radiation, especially in childhood, is the only known environmental risk factor for developing meningioma. Symptoms depend on the size of the tumour, changes in vision, headaches, hearing loss and seizures.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. People with a genetic disorder known as neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are more likely to develop meningiomas because they have inherited a gene that has the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous.
