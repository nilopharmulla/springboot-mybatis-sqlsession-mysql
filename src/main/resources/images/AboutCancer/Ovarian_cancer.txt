Ovarian cancer

In Ovarian cancer, certain cells in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. Older age, obesity, fertility drugs, family history of ovarian/breast cancer can increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer symptoms can be non-specific, such as loss of appetite and weight loss, abnormal periods, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Family history of breast/ovarian cancer and personal history of breast cancer increases the risk of ovarian cancer.
