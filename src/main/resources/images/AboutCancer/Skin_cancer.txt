Skin cancer

Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells. Most often develops on skin exposed to the sun. But this common form of cancer can also occur on areas of your skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. Symptoms may include scaly itchy patches on skin, irregular bordered moles with unusual colours, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. If you have a family history of melanoma and you also have a lot of unusual moles, you’re at a higher risk for developing this type of cancer.
