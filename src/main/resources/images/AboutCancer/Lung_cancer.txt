Lung cancer

Lung cancer forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. People who smoke are at a higher risk of lung cancer. Symptoms may include coughing up blood or rust-coloured sputum, shortness of breath, persistent infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. It has been estimated that 8% of lung cancers are linked to a genetic predisposition. Inherited genetic mutations may make you more likely to develop lung cancer, especially if you smoke or are exposed to other carcinogens.
