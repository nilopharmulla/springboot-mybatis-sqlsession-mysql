Leukemia

Leukemia generally refers to cancers of the WBCs which primarily hinders the body's ability to fight infection. Smoking, blood disorders, exposure to high radiations, etc. are some of the risk factors for leukemia. Leukaemia may cause symptoms that include fatigue, weight loss, frequent infections and easy bleeding or bruising.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Having a close family member with leukemia increases the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Genetic disorders such as downâ€™s syndrome also increase the risk of leukemia.
