Liver cancer

Liver cancer can be classified in two ways. Primary liver cancer is one that starts in the tissue of the liver. Secondary liver cancer is cancer that started in some other place in the body and moved to the liver. Certain medical conditions, with the increasing age, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, gallstones, etc. elevate the liver cancer risk. Symptoms may include weight loss, stomach pain, vomiting and yellowed skin.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. People with hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection who also had a family history of liver cancer were at the highest risk of developing liver cancer, especially at a young age.
