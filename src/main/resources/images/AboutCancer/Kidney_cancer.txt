Kidney cancer

Kidney cancer, commonly known as renal cell carcinoma, is a disease in which kidney cells become malignant (cancerous) and grow out of control, forming a tumor. Kidney cancer is mainly associated with the smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, etc. Symptoms may include blood in the urine, low back pain on one side, a lump on the side or lower back, etc.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. People who have a strong family history of kidney cancer may have an increased risk of developing the disease.
