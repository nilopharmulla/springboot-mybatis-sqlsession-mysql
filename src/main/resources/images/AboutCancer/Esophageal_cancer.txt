Esophageal cancer

Esophageal cancer begins when the inner lining cells of the esophagus (also called the food pipe) grows in uncontrolled way. Smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and poorly controlled acid reflux are significant risk factors for oesophageal cancer. Symptoms include trouble swallowing, unintentional weight loss, chest pain, worsening indigestion or heartburn and coughing or hoarseness.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations.
