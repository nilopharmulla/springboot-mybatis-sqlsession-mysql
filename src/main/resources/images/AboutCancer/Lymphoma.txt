Lymphoma

Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's germ-fighting network. There are two types of lymphoma, Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is the most common type, typically develops from B and T lymphocytes (cells) in the lymph nodes or tissues throughout the body. Symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, and weight loss.
The increased risk of cancer is related to inherited faulty genes, which pass down through the generations. Having a family history of lymphoma increases the risk of lymphoma.
